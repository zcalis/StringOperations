# StringOperations
This is a maven project. The code written in Java as you know
I set the compiler settings for Java 1.8 in pom.xml
You can do git clone from the repo after that you can open it by using IntelliJ or any IDE for Java that you prefer. 
Then you can open the folder by click File>Open. Obviously you need to show the path where you cloned the repo in your local.
You need to import the dependencies from pom.xml in this case there is only JUnit as a dependency for running unit tests.
To do right click on pom.xml and select Maven and click Generate Folders and Update Imports. This will import the dependencies.
After that you need to click on src/test/java and you will see two classes which are StringModifier and UnitTest
Right click each of those files and click Run button
Please let me know any questions and concerns.
